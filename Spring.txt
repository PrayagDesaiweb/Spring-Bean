# Spring-Bean
Spring bean scopes and life cycle 

What Is bean scope?
The scope represents the lifecycle of the bean
Which means 
1.how ling the bean will live
2.how many instances are created
3.how is the bean shared
Default scope of the bean is singleton. Which means
Spring container will create one instance of the bean by default, it is cached in the memory, all request to the bean will return shared reference to the same bean.

For explicity defining the scope of the bean use the scope attribute
Additional spring beans are prototype, request, session, global-session

In the prototype scope, everytime we make a request to the bean, new object (new instance of the bean is created). Prototype is used for taking care of stateful data
